    <div class="animation__container" style="height: 800px;">
        <p style="color: #1d2073">The storyline of Animation Video 1 centers around a kid named Blue who struggles to find interest in school and spends most of his time in his room.
            He isn't doing so great in school, and has trouble connecting with his friends. However, he makes a change for the better after being engrossed
            in an almost magical book his teacher assigns him. He learns to take academics seriously and enjoys playing soccer, in the end reconnecting
            with his friends and being thankful for his teacher setting him down his new path. As the main character's name suggests, the story is mostly animated in various shades of blue. The notable exception to this is his teacher, who is a 
            vibrant shade of pink, representing her optimism and contrasting Blue's disposition.

                <h2>The Protagonist</h1>
                <p>The storyline of UVoyage centers around a little kid in school, Blue, who is uninterested in anything and likes to spend most of his time in his room.
                    He isn't doing so great in school, and has trouble connecting with his friends. However, over time, he experiences character growth with the help of his teacher, Name 2.

                <h2>Side Characters</h1>
                <p>Besides Blue, Name 2, and his friends, there aren't many other notable characters. That being said, there are many people in the background, since this is a busy middle school.
                    These people in the animations are almost like "extras" in a film.
